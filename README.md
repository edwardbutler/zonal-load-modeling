This program that I wrote during freshman year structures time series data of zonal load and temperature in a SQLite database and then creates a model (implemented as a Random forest decision tree by sk-learn) which uses temperature to predict zonal load over various regions. See the comments I left at the top of the files importer.py and model.py for instructions on how to run.
